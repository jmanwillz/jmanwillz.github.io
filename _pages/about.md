Hi there! I’m Jason Wille, a software engineer on a mission to conquer the realms of machine learning, one algorithm at a time. I’m always up for a coding challenge, enjoy a good debugging session, and—yes—even wrote this bio with the help of my AI sidekick (who insists it’s the brains behind the operation). When I’m not buried in code, I’m probably learning something new, connecting with other tech enthusiasts, or plotting my next move into the machine learning world. Take a look around, check out my GitHub, and let’s connect!
